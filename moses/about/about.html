    <div class="h3">Introduction</div>
    <p>The program should simulate two dice rolls with the following rules a. The simulation should begin with a human
      and a computer selection with four spot: red,blue,yellow,green ai. The human chooses two colors and the computer
      takes the remaining aii. The first to make a choice is the first to start the game b. The first 60 die rolls
      should be analysed in the following order bi> The system begins with a 6 and any other number bii> If the first
      person does not have a 6 the next roll goes to the next player this continues until there is a 6. biii> If two 6
      are recorded the system should tell the currently player to roll again biv> The system should predict the
      different ways the human or the computer can make their move example : human die 1. [6,2] computer die 2. [1,2]
      human die 3. [3,4] computer die 4. [6,6] computer die 5. [1,6] human die 6. [3,2] computer die 7. [5,6] NB: The
      person with the highest number wins the simulation.</p>
